# Testosterone Levels and Gaming Behavior Analysis

## Motivation
In modern society, gaming has become a significant part of daily life, influencing both physical and psychological well-being. Testosterone, a key hormone associated with energy, motivation, and competitive behavior, may be impacted by or influence gaming habits. As someone interested in understanding the interplay between hormonal health and digital behaviors, this project aims to explore the relationship between testosterone levels and gaming behavior.

By analyzing this connection, the project seeks to uncover how gaming intensity, duration, or type (e.g., competitive vs. casual gaming) might affect testosterone levels, potentially offering insights into how digital habits impact hormonal balance and overall health. Through this analysis, I aim to answer the following questions:

- **Does my testosterone level vary with the amount of time I spend gaming?**
- **Does the type of gaming (e.g., competitive vs. casual) influence my testosterone levels?**
- **Are there specific gaming patterns that correlate with fluctuations in testosterone?**

## Dataset Description

### 1. Testosterone Data
- **Source**: Personal Test
- **Fields**:
  - **Date**  
  - **Time of Day** (since testosterone levels fluctuate diurnally)  
  - **Testosterone Level** (ng/dL or nmol/L)  
  - **Additional Metadata** (e.g., gender, cortisol level, if collected)

### 2. Gaming Behavior Data
- **Source**: Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, or mobile gaming logs (via gaming platform APIs or manual tracking)  
- **Fields**:
  - **Date**  
  - **Gaming Duration** (hours)  
  - **Game Type** (e.g., Competitive: FPS like Valorant; Casual: Simulation like Stardew Valley)    
  - **Platform** (e.g., PC, Console, Mobile)

## Data Collection Process

- **Testosterone Data**:  
  Testosterone levels will be taken datasets.

- **Gaming Behavior Data**:  
  Gaming data will be collected by exporting activity logs from gaming platforms (e.g., Steam API, PlayStation Network reports) or manually logging gaming sessions. If APIs are unavailable, a daily journal of gaming duration, game type, and session intensity will be maintained.

## Project Plan

### 1. Data Collection
1. Measure and record testosterone levels using a testing kit over the study period.  
2. Collect gaming behavior data through platform logs or manual tracking for the same date range.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean and structure the testosterone and gaming datasets for analysis (e.g., align dates, standardize units).
- Handle missing or inconsistent values (e.g., interpolate missing testosterone data if appropriate, or exclude incomplete gaming logs).
- Categorize gaming sessions into types (e.g., competitive, casual) and intensity levels for analysis.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends in testosterone levels and gaming behavior over time using line plots or scatter plots.
- Analyze correlations between gaming duration, game type, and testosterone levels (e.g., using Pearson correlation).
- Investigate daily or weekly patterns (e.g., do testosterone levels spike on days with intense gaming sessions?).

### 4. Modeling
- Apply statistical methods (e.g., regression analysis) to quantify the relationship between gaming behavior and testosterone levels.
- Explore machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict testosterone levels based on gaming duration, type, and intensity.
- Include control variables (e.g., sleep quality, stress) if collected, to account for confounding factors.

### 5. Visualization and Reporting
- Create interactive charts (e.g., using Plotly or Matplotlib) to present trends, such as testosterone fluctuations alongside gaming hours.
- Summarize findings in a report, highlighting key insights (e.g., “Competitive gaming sessions of over 2 hours correlate with a 10% increase in testosterone levels”).
- Discuss implications for health and gaming habits, along with recommendations for further research.
